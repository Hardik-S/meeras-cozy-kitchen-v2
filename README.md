# Meera v2

This repository is the isolated workspace for Meera v2.

## Status

Setup only. Product implementation has not started.

## Version Boundary

The parent folder contains Meera v1. V1 is considered complete and frozen. Future work should happen here in `v2/` so v1 stays stable as a finished baseline.

## Rationale

Keeping v2 in a separate folder and repository gives the project a clean history, independent deployment path, and a clear rollback boundary. It also lets future work copy useful v1 patterns without creating accidental changes in the original site.

## Decisions

- Use `v2/` as the only editable product workspace for the next version.
- Keep this repo independent from the parent v1 Git repository.
- Start with documentation and repository setup only.
- Wait for the next user instructions before selecting a framework, copying assets, or deploying.

## Approaches Considered

- Continue work in the v1 root repo. Rejected because the user marked v1 done and asked that the original site no longer be touched.
- Create a branch in the v1 repo. Rejected because a branch still shares repository history and makes accidental v1 edits easier.
- Create a separate sibling folder outside the workspace. Rejected because the user asked for a new subfolder.

## Next Step

Wait for the user's v2 instructions before implementation begins.
